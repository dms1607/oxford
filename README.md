This directory contains the code I used for building the prototype for my dissertation project of the MSc Software Engineering.

Files:

-pipeline.RData: how to run the entire analytical pipeline from start to end given a sample gene (here 'Stat3')

-pipeline_streamlined.R: the shorter version of the above without all the library installations to make things faster every time you want to run it
